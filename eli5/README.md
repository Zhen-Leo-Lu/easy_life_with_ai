# ELI5 — Explain Like I'm 5

One button to learn something new. Random complex concepts explained simply.

## Usage

```bash
python eli5.py
```

That's it. Run it again for a new concept.

## Example Output

```
==================================================
🧒 ELI5: QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT
==================================================

Imagine you have two magic dice. When you roll one and it shows 
a 6, the other die INSTANTLY shows a 6 too — even if it's on 
the other side of the world!

That's kind of like quantum entanglement. Two tiny particles 
become best friends, and whatever happens to one immediately 
affects the other, no matter how far apart they are...
