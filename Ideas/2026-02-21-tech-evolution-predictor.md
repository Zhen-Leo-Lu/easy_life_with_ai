# Tech Evolution Predictor

**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Status:** Project  
**Project:** [morning_tech_report](../morning_tech_report/)

## Summary
A framework for forecasting future technology developments by identifying patterns in historical tech emergence and applying them to current market signals.

## Details

Technology evolution follows recognizable patterns. By cataloging these patterns and matching them against current signals, we can make educated predictions about what comes next.

### The Core Insight

| Historical Pattern | Current State | Predicted Future |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| LLMs (GPT, Claude) emerged | AI coding tools (Cursor) handle mid-level tasks | Autonomous software engineers? |
| Search engines → Google dominance | AI assistants fragmented | Unified AI orchestration layer? |
| Mobile apps explosion | AI agents emerging | AI app ecosystem? |

### Key Components

1. **Pattern Library** — Catalog historical tech emergence patterns (e.g., "foundation tech → specialized tools → consolidation")
2. **Current Signal Tracker** — Aggregate real-time data: funding trends, research papers, product launches, job postings
3. **Cross-Reference Engine** — Match current signals against historical patterns
4. **Prediction Generator** — Produce forecasts with confidence levels and timelines

## Potential Benefits

- Generate investment theses based on pattern recognition
- Inform career planning and skill development priorities
- Validate startup ideas against historical precedent
- Support strategic planning for tech companies

## Implementation Notes

### Data Sources
- Crunchbase (funding, startups)
- arXiv (research papers)
- HackerNews (developer sentiment)
- Twitter/X (real-time signals)
- Job boards (demand indicators)
- Patent filings (R&D direction)

### Approach Options
1. **Manual framework** — Start with structured research methodology
2. **Semi-automated** — Use AI to aggregate and summarize sources
3. **Full system** — Build automated pipeline with prediction dashboard

### Challenges
- Distinguishing signal from noise
- Avoiding confirmation bias
- Accounting for black swan events
- Calibrating prediction confidence

## Open Questions

- Scope: Personal thinking framework, tool/product, or research project?
- Focus area: All tech, or specific domains (AI, developer tools, consumer tech)?
- Output format: Written predictions, visualizations, discussion forum?
- Priority level: Active build or capture for later?
