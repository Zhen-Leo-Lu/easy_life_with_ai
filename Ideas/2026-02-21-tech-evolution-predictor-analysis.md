| **Capabilities** | 22-DOF hands, 24hr battery, FSD neural architecture |

### 💰 Capital Concentration — Winner-Take-Most

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Mega rounds** | Anthropic $30B (valued $380B), ElevenLabs $500M, Runway $315M |
| **Velocity** | 3 companies crossed $1B raised before March 2026 |
| **AI dominance** | >50% of global VC flowing to AI |
| **Investor focus** | Traction over potential; monetization clarity required |

### 🧠 Model Capabilities — New Paradigms

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Reasoning models** | Now the standard for best-in-class problem-solving |
| **Massive context** | Ultra-long context windows with autonomous memory |
| **Open source rise** | DeepSeek R1, Qwen becoming Silicon Valley defaults (cost + customization) |
| **Agentic AI** | Moving from pilots to production (finance, supply chain, customer service) |

### ⚡ Infrastructure — Hyperscale Build-out

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **Investment** | $500B+ projects (Stargate: OpenAI/Oracle/SoftBank) |
| **Energy** | Data centers consuming 1+ gigawatts; nuclear/space solar explored |
| **Architecture** | Entire data centers designed as single computers |

## Part 2: Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Foundation → Specialization → Consolidation
```
LLMs (2022-2024) → AI coding tools (2024-2025) → Autonomous agents (2026)
                                               → Self-programming systems (2026+)
```

### Pattern 2: Software → Embodiment
```
Self-driving (software) → Robotaxis (2024-2025) → Humanoid robots (2026)
                                                → General-purpose physical AI (2027+)
```

### Pattern 3: Expensive → Cheap → Ubiquitous
```
GPT-4 ($$$) → Open source models ($) → On-device AI (free) [happening now]
Robot ($250K) → Robot ($20K) → Robot as appliance ($5K?) [2027-2028?]
```

### Pattern 4: Human-in-loop → Human-on-loop → Human-out-of-loop
```
Copilot (autocomplete) → Cursor (task execution) → Claude Code (autonomous PR)
                                                 → OpenSage (self-designing agents)
```

## Part 3: Predictions — What Future Will Be Like

### Near-term (2026-2027)

| Domain | Prediction | Confidence |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Coding** | AI agents handle 60-70% of routine software tasks; human developers shift to architecture, review, edge cases | High |
| **Robotics** | 50K+ humanoids deployed globally; primarily automotive, warehousing | High |
| **Models** | Open-source models dominate for startups; proprietary for cutting-edge reasoning | Medium |
| **Jobs** | "AI operator" becomes a job title; managing fleets of AI agents | Medium |

### Mid-term (2027-2029)

| Domain | Prediction | Confidence |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Coding** | Junior developer role transforms to "AI trainer/reviewer"; new grads work differently | High |
| **Robotics** | Consumer humanoids emerge ($10-20K); home assistant category | Medium |
| **Enterprise** | "AI-native" companies outcompete; 10-person startups compete with 100-person teams | High |
| **Infrastructure** | AI compute becomes utility (like cloud); smaller players access frontier capabilities | Medium |

### Long-term (2029-2032)

| Domain | Prediction | Confidence |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Software** | Most codebases self-maintaining; AI handles bugs, updates, optimization | Medium |
| **Physical** | Humanoid robots common in service industry (retail, hospitality, healthcare) | Medium |
| **Economy** | Productivity explosion; GDP growth accelerates; income distribution debates intensify | Low-Medium |
| **Creative** | AI as creative collaborator standard; "prompt engineering" becomes "vision articulation" | Medium |

## Part 4: Actionable Implications

### If you're a developer:
- Learn to orchestrate AI agents, not just write code
- Specialize in areas AI struggles: ambiguous requirements, cross-system architecture, human stakeholder management
- Experiment with finetuning models on your own codebases (SERA-style)

### If you're building a startup:
- Assume 10x productivity from AI — plan team size accordingly
- Consider physical AI layer — software + robots is underexplored
- Open-source models as foundation; don't pay frontier prices for commodity tasks

### If you're investing:
- Infrastructure layer still has room (energy, specialized compute)
- Application layer consolidating; look for vertical-specific winners
- Physical AI is early — equivalent to "AI in 2022"
